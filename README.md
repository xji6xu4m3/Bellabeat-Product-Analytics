# Bellabeat Product Analytics

This case study focuses on analyzing the smart devices for Bellabeat and providing insights for their marketing strategy team.

In this case, I will use **SQL** to extract data from a large dataset to answer business questions. Additionally, I will use **Tableau** and **Rstudio** to create dashboards and plots for analysis. I will also utilize the **Python** machine learning package to make predictions for the team.

The business questions that I will answer include:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
